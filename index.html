									<p>Long ago in Italy there lived on old clock-maker named Geppetto. Tick-tick-TOCK! Tick-tick-TOCK!
										went all the clocks in his shop. When he worked, Geppetto felt happy. But when he rested, a sad
										feeling came over him. “Ah!” he would think. “All my life and no child to call my own!” So, one day
										Geppetto carved a puppet from wood in the shape of a boy.</p>
									<p>He made the arms and legs of the puppet so they could move. He cut and sewed a nice outfit for it,
										as if it were a real boy. "I will call you Pinocchio," said Geppetto. That night, Geppetto lay the
										wooden puppet down onto the bed.</p>

									<p>From out of the window, a big star twinkled bright. Geppetto looked out the window to the twinkling
										star. </p>

									<!-- <p>“Bright star,” said Geppetto. “If I could make one wish, it would be for a real boy of my own.” But of course, he knew that was not possible.</p>
									
									<p>That night, the same big star swooshed right into Geppetto’s room. It changed into a Blue Fairy!  The Blue Fairy flew over to the bed.</p>
									
									<p>“Little wooden puppet,” said the Blue Fairy. “In the morning, you will be able to walk and talk like a real boy.” She tapped the puppet one time with her wand. “And if someday you can prove that you are brave and true, you may become a real boy.”</p>
									
									<p>Pinocchio’s eyes opened.</p> -->

										And with that, the Blue Fairy went swoosh and was gone! Out of the window and up into the night sky.

									<p>When Geppetto woke up the next morning, he said, “I will go take my puppet out of bed.” But the bed
										was empty!</p>

									<p>“Here I am, Father!” said Pinocchio from the other side of the room.</p>

									<p>Geppetto swung around. “What? You can talk?”</p>

									<p>“Yep! I am Pinocchio, your boy!”</p>

									<p>“How can this be?” said Geppetto in shock. Then he said, “But who cares?” He rushed over and swept
										the wooden puppet into his arms. “Pinocchio, my son!” he said in great happiness.</p>
